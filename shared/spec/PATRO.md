# Patro: spec (v1)

The patro (पात्रो, the Nepali almanac): tithi (lunar day), gazetted public holidays and events per
BS day. Every port ships it in a separate package that depends on the core package; package names
per language are in ADR-0004. Source:
`data/patro/<year>.json` (ADR-0002). Currently covers **BS 2077–2084** (tithi 2078-01-02 …
2083-12-30, holidays 2077-01-01 … 2084-08-18, events 2077-01-01 … 2084-08-20).
Days without data are absent from the files.

## 1. JSON shape (input)

```json
{ "schema": 1, "source": {...}, "year": 2081,
  "days": {
    "2081-01-01": {
      "tithi":   { "np": "पञ्चमी", "en": "Panchami" },
      "holiday": true,
      "events":  [ { "np": "नयाँ वर्ष", "en": "New Year" }, ... ]
    } } }
```

All three fields are optional per day. `holiday` absent = `false`. Event order is significant
(display order).

## 2. Query semantics (every port)

```
info(date) -> CalendarInfo {
    tithi:     Option<{np, en}>
    is_public_holiday: bool
    events:    ordered list of {np, en} (possibly empty)
}
```

- `info` never fails. Dates without data return `{None, false, []}`.
- `coverage()` returns the smallest BS range containing every day that has any metadata
  (`2077-01-01 ..= 2084-08-20` today). The widget uses it to decide whether to show
  "no data for this year".
- `public_holidays()` returns an ascending iterator of all holiday dates.
- `name(lang)` on tithi/event returns `np` for `Lang::Ne` and `en` for `Lang::En`.

## 3. Compiled layout (every port)

The tables live only in the patro package; the core package has none of them and no reference to
the patro package. Ports compile `data/patro/` into constant tables. JSON is never read at runtime. The layout is
each port's choice, but these facts should shape it:

- Tithi data is **contiguous**: one entry for every day from 2078-01-02 to 2083-12-30
  (T = 2190). Store the first serial and one small index per day into a table of 32 tithi
  names, so a lookup is one subtraction and one array read. The generator must fail if a gap
  appears inside the tithi range.
- Holidays (H = 294) and event days (E = 1671, 3032 events) are sparse. Store sorted serials
  and binary search them (ALGORITHM §4), at most 11 comparisons.
- Event and tithi names repeat. Deduplicate the (np, en) pairs: 753 distinct pairs today.
- Events of one day keep file order.
- Alternative allowed: dense per-day tables over the covered days (one small index per day for
  holidays and event slices) give O(1) lookups with no binary search. A port may use them when its
  benchmark shows they are faster at an acceptable size (the C++ plan does, about 82 KB in total).

The Rust layout is in `nepdate-rust` (task L5-01) as a worked example.

## 4. Test anchors (from the C# test suite, confirmed against data)

| Date | Tithi (en) | Holiday | Events (en, in order) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2081-01-01 | Panchami | yes | New Year, Mesh Sankranti, Bisket Jatra |
| 2081-01-02 | Shashthi | no | (none) |
| 2081-02-15 | Panchami | yes | Republic Day |
| 2080-11-01 | Chaturthi | no | Mangala Chauthi Brata, People's War Day, Tilakund Chauthi, Kumbha Sankranti, World Radio Day |
| 2081-04-15 | Dashami | no | Kheer Khane Din, World Day Against Human Trafficking, International Friendship Day |
| 2070-06-15, 2090-01-01 | none | no | none |
